# TextFileSplitter
Split Large Text Files

While back I downloaded a file with over 500M lines and over 20gb of size.
No text editor could open my file so i decided to split it.

The code is somewhat functional but after 10M lines program is running really slow.
My plan was to add threading to speed up the process but threading part is not functioning correctly.
